        <h1>Musings on making a personal website</h1>
        <p class="datestamp">Monday, June 9, 2014</p>
        <p>It's been a long struggle. I've owned this domain for over 3 years
        now, but it's only today that I actually have put anything of meaning
        on it.</p>
        <p><strong>Today, that all changes.</strong> This is the start of a new era in the life
        of Omar Diab! One where he is a prudent citizen of the web!</p>
        <p>OK, let's be real here. In all likelihood, that won't be the case.
        But I can try, and so, here goes! A short chronicle of how I ended up
        coding this thing on a Sunday night before my last final of my
        undergraduate career.</p>
        <h2>Attempt #1: The PHP Mega-Platform&trade;</h2>
        <p>During my first attempt to make a personal website, I had grand
        ambitions but little experience. I wanted to make the be-all-end-all
        platform for making personal websites.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to overcome thinking about making a personal website,
        I decided I wanted everyone else to stop thinking about it, too.</p>
        <p>So I tried to make a general platform in the one language I knew,
        PHP. It was disastrous and I spent so much time architecting
        bad abstractions that reflected my inexperience that I never finished
        it.</p>
        <h2>Attempts #2 and #3: Descent into framework-mania</h2>
        <p>At that point, fresh out of the Stanford web development course,
        I decided that the web development community had something going for
        it, and that I need not reinvent the wheel. So I tried my best to make
        an over-engineered Rails app that would handle anything I could
        possibly want from a personal website.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I never finished that one either, and out of
        desperation I wrote a Sinatra application that lay dormant and
        contained nothing until this very day.</p>
        <h2>I realized that I never really thought about why I even wanted a
          webpage, and I was designing software for no particular reason.</h2>
        <p>There's nothing wrong with coding for the fun of it, and I chose the
        approaches and frameworks I did because I wanted to have practical
        experience in those things. But never did I question the purpose of my
        work, as being an amateur in academia, I saw few opportunities and
        little time to spend on practical applications.</p>
        <h2>A beautiful, lovely rebirth</h2>
        <p>It's 4AM. The Target-brand oscillating table fan has been running
        all day. A balloon, anchored to the ground by a plastic weight,
        violently jerks back and forth with the turning of the fan, slowly but
        surely inching around the room. The two objects
        oscillate back and forth chaotically, yet the balloon remains directly
        in the path of the fan. It never wanders away from the fan's buffets
        and streams.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the simplicity of that ridiculous, mind-numbing sight,
        I decided to scrap it all, write a simple, static application and
        throw it on Github Pages in the span of a few hours that will be
        cheaper to run and more likely to stay up than any of my previous
        attempts at expressing myself on the web. This page is the
        product of that work.</p>
        <p>No databases. No templating. Just HTML, CSS, and some JS to soften the
        edges. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        <p>So, why? I've decided I want a personal website for these reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>To encourage myself to communicate more on the
            web.</strong> I've
          never been one to blog; I don't follow Twitter and my Facebook page
          is home to contextless non sequiturs to my friends. I want to write
          more in general, but I lack the impetus to do so; I want to
          understand trends on the web, but I feel paralyzed with most that
          exists today. This is a step for me to establish my presence
          online.</li>
          <li><strong>To express myself uniquely.</strong> I search for visual, textual, and
          auditory ways to represent myself all the time. I cannot say for
          certain why; Perhaps it's mere egotism, but more likely people just
          search for the validation that comes from social interaction and this
          is merely a manifestation of that. Regardless, I value the feeling of
          putting myself out there, and this is one form of that goal.</li>
          <li><strong>To solidify my understanding of the underpinnings of
          frontend web development.</strong> This is not a very interesting
          point, as it's purely vocational.</li>
          <li><strong>To say I've done it, to put this long, drawn-out project
            behind me. To. Move. On.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>None of these require fancy extensibility or solid engineering. A
        site like this is so simple it requires none of the bells and whistles
        the modern web has brought us.</p>
        <p>Hence, I am here today, writing this text directly into an HTML
        file. And I intend to keep it this way (and maybe make it look nicer on
        mobile ;)).</p>
        <h2>So carry on, we shall!</h2>
